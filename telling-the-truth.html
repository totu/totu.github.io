<title>»»t0p1 // Telling the truth - or at least not lying</title><h1>Telling the truth</h1>
<h2>or at least not lying</h2>
<p><br>
Regardless of what you think about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson" title="Jordan Peterson - Wikipedia">Jordan Peterson</a> I don’t think you can deny that some of his ideas in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Rules_for_Life" title="12 Rules for Life - Wikipedia">12 Rules for Life</a> are worth while.</p>
<p>My current favorite is rule 8:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Tell the truth – or, at least, don't lie.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there is something fundamental about this "rule".</p>
<p>Recently I have tried to observe myself in my daily activities and I feel like I consistently catch myself lying. Nothing major, nothing supposedly harmful, but nonetheless still lies. Like describing not getting good sleep for couple of days as “hanging on with 4 hours of sleep for couple of days” even though as you can see from the actual data even on my worst night I managed to get 5 hours of sleep in.</p>
<p><br>

<blockquote>
<p>For non-Finnish speakers left time is “time in bed” and right one is “in sleep”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes it is about stating something as a fact even though I only have a vague feeling that I am right - thankfully so far I have been right and haven’t had to eat my words, but I still don’t like the feeling I get when I catch myself in a lie and worst of all in a lie that doesn’t even matter.</p>
<p>Peterson goes into the topic saying that speaking truth is hard and that you have to start by stopping lying first before you can start telling the truth and I really feel like this is the case. How can I trust myself to tell the truth when I daily catch myself lying to my friends, colleagues, and myself?</p>
<p>I guess all I can do is to work on myself and hopefully I can come out as a better person and maybe someone I can start telling the truth instead of merely not lying.</p>        </main>
