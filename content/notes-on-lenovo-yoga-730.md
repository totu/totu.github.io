# Notes on Lenovo Yoga 730
<p></p>
## Software
- Windows Update
    - Makes screen better
    - Makes WiFi better
- Dolby Atmos
    - Change to "Dynamic"
- Lenovo Vantage
    - Good battery tracking
    - Claims to disable mic and camera
        - Messing around with OpenCV in Python pulled webcam even though it should have been locked.
        - Now in locked state camera still streams a grey picture with white crossed out camera on it.
    - There is some speed battery charging option, currently "safe battery life" option in use.
    - Rest is useless garbage
- Uninstall MacCafee!!!
- Firefox
    - Disable smooth scrolling
    - TrackPad Gesture modification?
    - Three finger swipe can be modified in Windows (also has 4 finger swipes for lulz)
    - Two finger swipe no supported
    - [I have created two finger swipe addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/swipetonavigate/) (apparently this is needed since it has **1000+** users)
- Scroll speed adjustment
    - Can be done from Windows

## Hardware
- Pen opens twice. Upper part require coin (or something similar)
    - Works fine with "LuonnoslehtiÃ¶" app
- fn+space for backlights is a good idea
- No media buttons :(
- Touch screen works fine
- Speakers are at the bottom ðŸ‘Ž
    - Sounds fine in tablet and stand mode
    - Not so good in soft surface
- Keyboard is good
- Track-pad is terrible
    - Random clicks from touching
    - Very stiff from the top
    - Very loose from the bottom
    - Sometimes bottom right side is right click, sometimes not
    - Two fingers swipe does nothing (maybe Windows thing?)
    - Was/is bug in Firefox
- Finger print scanner doesn't play well with Hello Windows
- Power button is on right side

## ~~TODO~~

- <del>Search if the TrackPad is as terrible for everyone else. (Maybe HW issue? Driver issue?)</del>
- **I've given this machine away and moved back to MacBooks.**
