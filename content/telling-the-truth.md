# Telling the truth
## or at least not lying

Regardless of what you think about [Jordan Peterson][1] I don’t think you can deny that some of his ideas in [12 Rules for Life][2] are worth while.

My current favorite is rule 8:

>“Tell the truth – or, at least, don't lie.”

I think there is something fundamental about this "rule".

Recently I have tried to observe myself in my daily activities and I feel like I consistently catch myself lying. Nothing major, nothing supposedly harmful, but nonetheless still lies. Like describing not getting good sleep for couple of days as “hanging on with 4 hours of sleep for couple of days” even though as you can see from the actual data even on my worst night I managed to get 5 hours of sleep in.

>For non-Finnish speakers left time is “time in bed” and right one is “in sleep”

Sometimes it is about stating something as a fact even though I only have a vague feeling that I am right - thankfully so far I have been right and haven’t had to eat my words, but I still don’t like the feeling I get when I catch myself in a lie and worst of all in a lie that doesn’t even matter.

Peterson goes into the topic saying that speaking truth is hard and that you have to start by stopping lying first before you can start telling the truth and I really feel like this is the case. How can I trust myself to tell the truth when I daily catch myself lying to my friends, colleagues, and myself?

I guess all I can do is to work on myself and hopefully I can come out as a better person and maybe someone I can start telling the truth instead of merely not lying.
