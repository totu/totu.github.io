title: True cost of Covid

# True cost of Covid

I used to believe that I came out of Covid without wounds. No one I knew died _because_ of the actual virus. No one in my immediate family lost their job or home. After the first year's adjustment my employer made record profit.

However there was far more insidious cost I hadn't realized until now. Over the last three years I have lost my life.

## Work
I've lost touch with many work collegues. Essentially I only have contact with my immediate team. Many people quit or moved to other projects. I haven't even seen some of the new hires and I don't think many people out side of my team even know what I do.

## Friends
Even before Covid most of my IRL friends moved to other cities, but we kept ties by playing video games while on Discord and doing one or two escape rooms every year. However with Covid we haven't seen eachother soon in four years and the game nights went away sometime during the pandemic as well. Essentially our Discord server currently serves as my "life blog" where I post pictures and whatever stuff I find with occational comments or reactions from one or two people.

Only activity that we have managed to keep us has been our Dungeon and Dragons group with game almost each week. However since the group was formed at work before pandemic we've lost part of the post-game discussion. Basically we just jump on a Discord call once or twice a week, play for few hours, and that's it. While it is far better than not doing anything it is not the same. Lack of face-to-face contact has erroded the roleplaying aspect by a lot and with some of the larger games it is far easier to fall into mindlessly doom scrolling while you wait others to solve some situation.

## Family
Family-wise I have also lost a lot. Starting with my mother. She had multiple health problems, but the pandemic really crushed her will to live. She used to go to different activities and hung out with her friends, but lockdown put an end to that. I remember the distress she felt after the first winter stuck inside. I started to take her to car rides at least once per week which I think helped, but as the lockdown went on and on she started to deteriorate. Eventually losing her ability to walk and with that the will to go on and with in weeks she was gone.

Worst part was that at the same time I lost contact with my siblings. My brother took our mother's passing hard and we had a falling out. My sister focused on her own family and life situation, which I can't fault her for, but at the same time we've met face-to-face two or three times after our mother's funeral. On otherside I've grown a bit closer to my father. However we aren't super close. While I used to visit my mother weekly for years, we only hang out with my father when there is something at my home that needs fixing or he has IT problems. Otherwise it is just chance encounters on the parking lot.

## Health
Health-wise before Covid I was in the best shape of my life. I was still grossly over weight, but I had some muscles and I felt strong, but with the gyms closing and the lockdown weight gains I am probably in the worst shape right now. Mentally I think I've changed a lot. I've grown to avoid people even more than before. Don't get me wrong, I never has extroverted, but I've become _much_ more introverted. At the store I find myself constantly annoyed by other people just going by their business. I am also way more pessimistic about the world. Maybe it is the Russian's invasion of Ukraine and how companies simply refuse to actually pull out since money is more important than human lives. Or the fact that China and United States are about to start a World War 3 over Taiwan. Or how fucking Turkey and Hungary still haven't ratified Finland or Sweden into NATO. Or maybe this is just what growing up is. I just feel so fucking helpless.
