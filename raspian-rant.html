<title>»»t0p1 // Raspian is broken AF!</title><h1>Raspian is broken AF!"</h1>
<p>I was repurposing a useless RPi4 board to serve as SMB server. I started by installing <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-32-bit" title="Rasberry Pi OS">latest Raspberry Pi OS Lite</a>. Steps to enable networking and headless SSH worked fine. I also found instructions on how to setup external drive to serve as samba share. Cool! Everything is fine, right? Wrong.</p>
<h2>Case of excess privileges</h2>
<p>After making sure my share worked with Windows, OS X, and iOS I started to harden my new pi. I did normal shit install &amp; enable <code>ufw</code>. Then install and setup <code>fail2ban</code>. Setup SSH keys, disable password login, cool - cool. Next I removed <code>pi</code> user from <code>sudo</code> group, but I forgot to add my own user... Shit... Maybe I still have my sudoes privileges since I haven't logged out yet.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">pi@jakorasia:~ $ sudo su
root@jakorasia:/home/pi#
</code></pre>
<p>Nice! But I felt like that shouldn't have worked. Let's check groups just in case I misstyped <code>usermod</code> or something</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">pi@jakorasia:~ $ groups
pi
</code></pre>
<p>WTF... That doesn't look correct. Is the sudoers file somehow broken?</p>
<pre><code class="language-conf">#
# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
#
# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of
# directly modifying this file.
#
# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.
#
Defaults    env_reset
Defaults    mail_badpass
Defaults    secure_path=&quot;/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin&quot;

# Host alias specification

# Cmnd alias specification

# User privilege specification

# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

# See sudoers(5) for more information on &quot;#include&quot; directives:
#includedir /etc/sudoers.d
</code></pre>
<p>Looks fine to me</p>
<p>Anyways at this point I setup my own account. Rebooted. Verified that the SMB share still worked. Flawless! But I just had to make sure and...</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">pi@jakorasia:~ $ groups
pi
pi@jakorasia:~ $ sudo su
root@jakorasia:/home/pi#
</code></pre>
<p>So what the hell is going on? After some more staring at <code>/etc/sudoers</code> and fiddling with the groups I realized that the last line (<code>#includedir /etc/sudoers.d</code>) isn't a comment. Let's check it out.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">root@jakorasia:/home/pi# ls /etc/sudoers.d/
010_at-export  010_pi-nopasswd    010_proxy  README
</code></pre>
<p>That <code>010_pi-nopasswd</code> looks pretty suspicious, don't you think?</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">root@jakorasia:/home/pi# cat /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd
pi ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
</code></pre>
<p><strong>NO. FUCKING. WAY!</strong> Rasbian ships with literally <strong>no root password</strong> for the <strong>default</strong> user. I guess this is fine, but how many people are running their RPis absolutely clueless about this <code>NOPASSWD</code> default? Maybe it is just me, but this kind of default seems almost heretical. Why even ship <code>sudo</code> if you are just going to bypass it? I guess the take away is that you really need to change that <code>pi</code> password to something secure or just install something else than Rasbian.</p>        </main>
