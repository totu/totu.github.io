Above each pair is a string that pushes them into the lock cylinder keeping it locked. Key with correct cut depths will push all the top pins of each pair above the shear line of the cylinder allowing it to turn.</p><p><img src=/img/pinpick.gif style=width:33%;margin-top:10px;margin-right:20px;float:left>Picking this lock requires two tools a pick and tension wrench. Tension wrench is L -shaped tool that inserted at the bottom of the lock. Intention is to turn the lock constantly into the direction it opens. Since the parts are not perfect this action creates friction between the best fitted pin and the lock, when the pin gets pushed out of the lock (with the pick) the lock will move a very tiny amount, but enough to prevent the pin from falling back in. At the same time the next best fitted pin will be in the position to be pushed above the sheer line.</p><h2>Abloy type locks a.k.a. disc locks</h2><p>Lock cylinder consists of multiple disc with cut out at different position on the edge. All of the disc need to be in correct position (so the cutouts line up) to allow lock bar, that is preventing the lock from turning, to fall into the cut out.</p><p><img src=/img/discpick.jpg style=width:33%;margin-top:10px;margin-left:20px;float:right>Picking this lock requires one specialized tool. The tool has one turning wheel that acts as tension wrench expect this time goal is to feel the bar catching each of the discs as they are turned. Other part is "free floating" disc turner that can move in and out of the lock through the turning wheel. With it the goal is to turn each disc in turn until all of the cutouts line up.</p> </main><footer> Copyleft All Wrongs Reserved. </footer></body><script type=text/javascript src=js/mode.js></script></html>
